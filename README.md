# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This is a project to kickstart my learning in the fields of HTML/CSS, JavaScript as well as git for version management. 

This project has been quite useful in refreshing the basics of the process of developing a web application. 


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This page displays some information about the various topics including: 

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Git
4. JavaScript

It also uses JavaScript and the developer console (accessed by pressing F12 on standard web browsers) to display the different topics and chooses a random one each time the page is refreshed to suggest what to study.
